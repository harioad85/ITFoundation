35_SAS On Storage Devices
Self-Assessment Sheet
Q1. What is a hard drive? 
Ans: Hardware is storage device which save or store data in the hard drive.
Q2. A hard drive consists of spinning _____________.
Ans non volatile magnetic storage.

Q3. Why are hard drives referred to as "non-volatile"? 
Ans: rapidly rotating platters.

Q4. Why do we refer to access on a hard drive as "random access."?
Ans. Retrieve data from any part od the drive at any time.

Q5. What are the components inside a hard drive? 
Ans: Spinning platters, moving actuator arm .

Q6. What is a limitation of hard drives? 
Ans: the access speed.

Q7. What is the eventual outcome of a hard drive? 
Ans: 

Q8. How does the data get stored and retrieved? 
Ans Data from the computer in electrical form is stored onto the hard disk in magnetic form.

Q9. What affects the speed of data retrieval? 
Ans: indexing increase the efficiency of data retrieval

Q10. If the drive is spinning faster, for example, at 15,000 rotations per minute, then the rotational latency lowers to about ________________.

Ans 2 ms

Q11. What does it mean if a common rotational speed for a low-end hard drive is 5,400 rotations per minute. And that gives you a rotational latency of about 5 and 1/2 milliseconds?
Ans. 5.55 ms 

Q12. What happens if the drive is spinning faster? 
Ans: read and write data in the drive .

Q13. What is the size of the hard drive in a larger desktop computer? 
Ans: 3.5


Q14. What is a solid-state drive? 
Ans. Non volatile memory and no moving parts.

Q15. Why do we use non- volatile memory in SSD?
Ans. Data remain on the ssd.

Q16. What is one significant advantage of an SSD? 
Ans: not mechanical problem for read and write data in the storage.

Q17. What type of interface is often used for hard drives? 
Ans: Sata Interface . for laptop.

Q18. What is the advantage of having a laptop or mobile device? 
Ans: small size of hard disk.

Q19. How does SATA limit the size of mobile devices? 
Ans: 2.5

Q20. What is mSATA? 
Ans: this is mini SATA shrink the SATA drive into smaller device .


Q21. What replaced the mSATA interface? 
Ans: m.2 


Q22. What is an example of a device that contains an mSATA drive? 
Ans: that is smaller drive and save more space inside the system.
Q23. How does the mSATA drive help reduce the overall size of devices? 
Ans: much better 3.5 drive 

Q24. AHCI stands for the__________________.
Ans. Advanced host controller interface

Q25. Why do we use AHCI?
Ans. AHCI to move drive data to RAM.


Q26. _____________uses a protocol known as AHCI.
Ans. SATA 

Q27. What is NVMe? 
Ans: NON volatile Memory express designed for ssd speed.

Q28. What is the throughput of SATA revision 3? 
Ans: through output up to 600 MB/s

Q29. What does lower latency and higher throughput mean? 
Ans: take advantage of the NVMe.

Q30. What are the advantages of using M.2 instead of SATA? 
Ans: smaller farm factor.


Q31. What kind of interface is M.2? 
Ans: can use pci express bus connection.

Q32. What type of throughput is typically seen when using an NVMe with an SSD through a by 4 PCIe interface? 
Ans: x4

Q33. What are the different keys in an M.2 interface? 
Ans: B and M key

Q34. What should you do to ensure the best possible throughput for an M.2-based SSD? 
Ans:  M.2 doesn't guarantee NVMe your M.2 interface

Q35. How do I install an M.2 drive on my motherboard? 
Ans: slot ssd to the motherboard b then other side screw for ssd in motherboard.

Q36. What does EEPROM stand for?
Ans electrically erasable programmable read only memory like as flash memory.

Q37. EEPROM is a type of _________ memory.
Ans. Flash memory

Q38. What are the advantages of flash memory? 
Ans: no power required to retain data .

Q39. What is one concern with flash memory? 
Ans: non volatile memory

Q40. Is it recommended to use flash drives as archival storage? 
Ans: easy to lose or damage 

Q41. What type of flash memory do cameras and other mobile devices use? 
Ans: yes

Q42. What type of storage is becoming increasingly difficult to find on our systems? 
Ans: compact drive or sd drive .

Q43. What does an optical drive use to read small pits or different colors on an optical disk? 
Ans: small bumps read with a laser beam 

Q44. What are some of the most popular formats of optical drives? 
Ans: CDROM DVD ROM and blue ray 

Q45. Are there external drives available for internal laptop or desktop use? 
Ans: usb
